    <p><!-- <-- changed: added opening <p> tag before paragraph text (was plain text without <p> in 2nd file); why: semantically correct paragraph and consistent styling -->Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
    strong
    family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
    communication.

    <p>
      There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
      <li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
      <li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
    </ul> <!-- <-- changed: removed stray </li> and ensured proper closing of </ul>; why: stray/mismatched </li> made list invalid -->

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>Fun fact: Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</strong></p> <!-- <-- changed: closed the <strong> tag (was not closed in 2nd file); why: fix inline formatting and valid markup -->
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <div class="facts-container">
      <div class="fact-card">🐘 Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors.</div> <!-- <-- changed: closed the fact-card div and made each fact its own separate div; why: 2nd file had mismatched nesting and missing closures, which broke layout -->
      <div class="fact-card">💧 They use their trunks like snorkels when swimming.</div>
      <div class="fact-card">🌿 They eat up to 300 pounds of food per day!</div>

  <div id="footer">
    <p>© 2025 Elephants of the World</p>
  </div> <!-- <-- changed: fixed footer tag which in 2nd file was written as <div id="footer" without closing > and missing closure; why: broken tag prevented footer rendering -->

</body> <!-- <-- changed: added closing </body> tag (was missing in 2nd file); why: complete document structure and correct HTML -->
</html> <!-- <-- changed: ensured final </html> closure; why: document must be properly closed -->
